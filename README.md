# Github Repositories Expolorer

The Github Repositories Explorer is a web application that allows users to search for Github users by username and display a list of all repositories associated with each search result. Users can enter the username of a Github user, and the application will retrieve the list of repositories for that user using the Github API. The application displays the list of repositories on the screen, allowing the user to explore and view details about each repository, such as the name, description, and URL. With this application, users can easily discover new Github repositories and explore the code and projects of other users on the platform.
